# Learning Google Cloud

I have extensive knowledge of AWS, but I have done damn near _nothing_ with Google Cloud thus far.

As I've been doing a **lot** with Terraform recently, I have been finding myself (perhaps incorrectly) "How hard can it be to pivot from AWS to GCP?"

I guess I'll find out soon! ðŸ™‚

## How to run everything

1. Replace your variables in `environment/cloud.tfvars` with the relevant and appropriate values for your environment.
2. Run `terraform init`
3. Run `terraform plan -var-file="environment/cloud.tfvars"` to check the plan.
4. Run `terraform apply -var-file="environment/cloud.tfvars"` to create the resources.

## How to tear it all down

1. Run `terraform destroy -var-file="environment/cloud.tfvars"`

If it fails the first time, run it a second (or third) time.

## Random things that were a bit challenging

* I'm definitely not a huge fan of how Google Cloud handles Ingress/Egress firewalls vs Security Groups, but perhaps I'll come to love it.

## To-Do

* Add a Load Balancer [https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/resources/compute_forwarding_rule]
